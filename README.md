# 🚀 AI Job Retrieval & Optimization Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that compares search and optimization algorithms (BFS, A*, Genetic Algorithm) for retrieving high-quality AI-related job postings from large-scale datasets.

👉 Focus: balancing **runtime efficiency** and **ranking quality** in real-world job search scenarios.

## 📌 Problem

Given thousands of job postings, how can we efficiently identify high-quality AI jobs while balancing multiple criteria?

- Salary  
- Experience level  
- Location  
- Work type  
- Data completeness  

---

## 🧠 Approach

We compare three algorithmic strategies:

### 🔹 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Exhaustive exploration of filtering combinations  
- Guarantees coverage but is computationally expensive  

### 🔹 A* Search
- Heuristic-guided search  
- Prioritizes promising job subsets  
- Achieves strong balance between speed and quality  

### 🔹 Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Evolutionary optimization approach  
- Handles multi-objective trade-offs  
- Efficient but may converge early
